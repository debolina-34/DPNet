# DPNet: Depthwise–Pointwise CNN for Audio Classification

This repository contains **DPNet**, a lightweight **Depthwise–Pointwise Convolutional Neural Network (CNN)** designed for efficient audio classification, with a focus on **resource-constrained and TinyML-oriented deployments**.

The work includes experiments on **original and amplitude-shifted audio data**, making the model robust to real-world variations in signal intensity.

## 🔍 Motivation

Conventional CNNs are often computationally expensive for embedded platforms.  
DPNet leverages **depthwise separable convolutions** to significantly reduce:

- Model size
- Number of parameters
- Inference latency

while maintaining competitive classification performance.
